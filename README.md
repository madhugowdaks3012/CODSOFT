Codsoft C++ Internship Project
Welcome to my repository showcasing the work completed during my one-month internship at Codsoft. This repository contains various projects and exercises that I worked on using C++ during the internship period. The goal of the internship was to deepen my understanding of C++ programming, develop practical skills, and contribute to real-world software development.

Internship Overview
Duration: 1 Month
Company: Codsoft
Role: C++ Intern
Focus: Developing C++ applications, debugging, and optimizing code.

Projects
Project 1: NumberGuesser
Description: The NumberGuesser project is a console-based game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low and keeps track of the number of attempts made by the user.

Navigate to the Project Directory:

Key Features:

Generates a random number within a specified range.
Provides user feedback on guesses (too high, too low, or correct).
Keeps track of the number of attempts.
Includes basic input validation to ensure correct user input.
Technologies Used: C++, Standard Library (STL)

Project 2: Basic Calculator
Description: The Basic Calculator project is a console application that performs basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user inputs two numbers and selects an operation, and the program outputs the result.

Key Features:

Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Handles invalid input gracefully with error messages.
Allows continuous calculations until the user decides to exit.
Technologies Used: C++, Standard Library (STL)

Project 3: To Do List
Description: The To Do List project is a console application that allows users to manage a list of tasks. Users can add, remove, and view tasks, as well as mark tasks as completed. This project provides a simple interface for task management and demonstrates file handling for saving and loading tasks.

Key Features:

Add new tasks to the list.
Remove tasks by specifying their index.
Mark tasks as completed.
View all tasks with their completion status.
Saves tasks to a file and loads them when the application starts.
Technologies Used: C++, File I/O, Standard Library (STL)
